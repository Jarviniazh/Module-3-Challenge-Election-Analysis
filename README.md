## Election Audit Summary
This script is a way to automate the process of tabulating the election results. With one small modification - updating the dataset file path, it will be used to audit not only other congressional district but also senatorial districts and local elections. 

Moreover, it could be a handy tool for federal election as well. This will involve few more modification. For example, change the dataset file path, for better understanding weâ€™d better change the variable names from county to state, and edit the print statement based on the audit requirements.
